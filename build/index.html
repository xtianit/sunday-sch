						We live in a world where light and darkness contend with one another and the advertisment of darkness 
						seem to be more apealing to mankind. Don't take side with people because their ideas seem good and your
						feelings support their cravings but humble yourself and support the righteous course of the Lord according
						to the Holy Scriptures. The Loed wants you to stand with Him and not against Him -

					God's provision of mannerwas satisfactory to the Jews until the mix multitude began to 
					point to them that everything was wromg with it. This similar action occurred in Eden as the 
					first parent hearkened to the strange Satan who found everything that God gave them to be wrong.
					Their agitation brought a new deal but also but also calamity where many died according to <a href="#" onclick="openModal('myModal4')">verse 33</a>. 
					Lets consider more on the lesson.

					<h2 class="font-extrabold text-teal-900">LESSON</h2>
					<h3 class="font-semibold mt-4">1. THE CARELESS CATCHES THE FLU</h3>
					<p>The scheme and actions of the mix multitude is highly contagious so that only
						the careful believersn will escape it. They will open your eyes to what they
						see other than what God requires you to see. They will entice and motivate you to
						join them and begin your own journey of rebellion towards God as in our text - 
						<a href="#" onclick="openModal('myModal15')">verse 4</a>,
						<a href="#" onclick="openModal('myModal16')">1 Cor. 10:12</a>,
						<a href="#" onclick="openModal('myModal22')">Isaiah 32:10</a>.
					</p>
						
				
					
					<h3 class="font-semibold mt-4">2. THE INSATIABLE WANTS OF MAN</h3>
					<p>It is true that man is never satisfied with what he has or receives.
						This same congragation had God's protection from all the plaques in Egypt.
						 All the silver and gold, including the best clothings of the Egyptians were 
						 given
						to them by God. They receive other acts of God including miraculous supply of water
						which no other nation has ever enjoyed. The manna was one of the numerous provisions
						of God to them yet they joined unbelievers to rebel against a loving God who is busy
						blessing them through His servant. If this is your present position then repent quickly before
						calamity will befall you. 
						<a href="#" onclick="openModal('myModal18')">Hebrew 13:5</a>,
						
					</p>
						
					<h3 class="font-semibold mt-4">3. LOST OF APETITE FOR GOD'S DEALINGS</h3>
					<p>
						In 
						<a href="#" onclick="openModal('myModal19')">Numbers 11:6</a>, they claimed to have lost
						apetite for God's provision and desired what the mix multitude showed them. Your union
						with the mix multitude will always create lost of joy in the things of God because their influence
						is based on their interest. - <a href="#" onclick="openModal('myModal20')">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>
						
					</p>
					
					<h3 class="font-semibold mt-4">CONCLUSION</h3>
					<p>
						Don't allow such evil company to sweep you away from the presence and blessings
						of God to destruction.
